# Air Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning models to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) based on various pollutant concentrations and meteorological factors.

## Objectives
- Predict AQI using real-world air quality datasets.
- Identify key features that influence air quality.
- Deploy a Streamlit web application for public use.

## How to Run
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`
